SETUP:

The tool can be built with:

	ant dist

Following a successful build, the tool can be launched with:

	java -jar dist/lib/ArchiveExplorer-*.jar <input.warc.gz>

USAGE:

URLs are displayed in the upper pane. Highlighting a URL will display:

1. Header information in the lower-left pane.
2. The payload of the record in the lower-right pane.

Double-clicking a URL will open the payload externally (this relies on the operating system to decide which program is used).
Right-clicking a single URL will prompt the user to save the file.
Right-clicking multiple URLs will prompt the user for a directory in which to save all the selected files.
